This project is a proof of concept demonstrating application of using on-chain data, coupled with time forecasting models (such as LSTMs) in an attempt to predict cryptocurrency price action. On-chain data is sourced from the public data provider GlassNode.

An interactive GUI dashboard was also created to demonstrate forecasted prediction, as well as additional supplementary analysis.
